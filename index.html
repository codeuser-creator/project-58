        <p> I like crochet because it makes me feel calm and relaxed. You can make a lot of things with yarn and a crochet hook. You can make clothes, stuffed animals which are called Amigurumi. You can make anything exept electronic devices. Or water bottles. You can do crochet anywhere but you have to have yarn and you have to have a crochet hook. </p>
